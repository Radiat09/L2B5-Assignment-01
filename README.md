### Type Inference in TypeScript

TypeScript has the extraordinary ability to automatically detect or assign types to variables even when you don't explicitly declare them.

**Examples:**

```typescript
let age = 25; // TypeScript infers `age` as `number`
let name = "Alice"; // TypeScript infers `name` as `string`
const isActive = true; // TypeScript infers `isActive` as `boolean`
```
